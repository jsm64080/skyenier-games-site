<!-- Notes for Mrs. McLeod:
        - The music bar would be something that follows along the page
        as the user scrolls. Not sure what structural element that would follow
        or if that is part of something we haven't learned yet.

        - The dropdown navigation menu is another one, since you click a button
        for it to appear. Not sure if this would act as some kind of linked file or if this
        is only achievable through CSS or JavaScript.

        The main downside of striving to make the best, most well-crafted and cared for games possible is that it doesn’t always lead to the most profits. These games take a lot of time and work, and if you want to play more games made by us, then the best way to support outside of playing our games is to give us all of your money! C’mon! 
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong class="three-digits">Tell me the three digits on the back too!</strong>
        <br>
        <br>
        Jokes aside though, all contributions are incredibly helpful and go directly to funding the team and our games. We want to pour as much time as possible into these games and give you all a great time, and maybe even make a difference in your life.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Thank you to all that support us by playing our games and donating!</strong>
        <br>
        <br>
